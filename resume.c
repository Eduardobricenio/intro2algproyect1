//then I'll show you the most common commands we saw in algorithm class.
//are linux commands that we use frequently in lab-made exercises

cd . // enter the directories
cd .. //get out of the directories
cd // enter the directory
ll //it serves to view the directories
ls // to see the existing files
mkdir // works to create a new directory
top //works to see the programs in progress
pdw // see your directory
nano test.c //it serves to create your file and edit it
gcc // in this you can compile your file
./a.out // runs the files
history // its function is to see all the commands you executed
clear // cleans all written functions
ctrl+x //save your written file


//Variables can be initialized, that is, set an initial value, at creation time. To do this, behind the identifier we put the character 'A' followed by the initial value. The initial values can be any valid constant for the type of variable we create. For example:

//an example of hello world with more common and simple variables

#include <stdio.h>
//names imported between <example>are libraries that depend on your code are used in specific use.

int main() 

//main It is the designated entry point for a program running in a hosted environment

{
//start of the main program

    printf("Hello World");
    //The printf function transports data from memory to the screen, as opposed to scanf, which sends data from the keyboard for storage in memory.

    return 0;
    //if the main function ends without a return statement the statement will be executed: return 0; . Which basically comes to say that the main function should return an int type.
}


//there are countless functions in language (c), but I will show the most used and most common.


char	//Caracter
int     //Signed Integer
float   //Single Float
double  //Double Floating
void    //Generic Nothing
printf()  //output by screen
scanf () //it is used to input data from the keyboard in a certain format
argc //integer contains the number of arguments that have been entered.
argv // array of character pointers
atoi() //Converts a string to its numeric value (integer)
atof() //Converts the initial portion of the string pointed by numPtr to a representation of double
